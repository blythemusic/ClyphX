""" This script allows you to create your own ClyphX actions that can be used like any other ClyphX action.

PLEASE NOTE: nativeKONTROL cannot provide support on writing Python code or on accessing Live's API through Python.
These are extremely vast subjects that would be difficult to support, particularly in the context of ClyphX, which
is sometimes difficult to support on its own.  However, this script is full of comments to help you.  Also, the rest
of the scripts in the ClyphX folder include plenty of examples of how to do things.  Lastly, we would make the
following recommendations:

- You can edit this file with any text editor, but an IDE makes this easier: http://wingware.com/

- To learn about Python: http://www.diveintopython.net/toc/index.html and http://www.google.com

- To learn the basics of MIDI Remote Scripts/Live API access: http://remotescripts.blogspot.com/

- Reference of Live functions and such that you can access: http://cycling74.com/docs/max5/refpages/m4l-ref/m4l_live_object_model.html

- After making changes to this file, you will need to recompile.  The quickest way to do that is by loading a set.  Note, however, that if you
  make a change that results in errors, this can sometimes break all control surface scripts (cause them to throw strange errors for no reason)
  until you reload Live.


TO CREATE ACTIONS:
 - You'll first add the action to the action_dict (dictionary below).

 - Then you'll add and implement a function that will be called when the action is triggered.

 - The function has to receive the following parameters: (self, track, args)

 - See the example functions below (example_action_one and example_action_two) for some examples of how to set up functions.

PARAMETER EXPLANATION:
- track = the track to apply the action to.  If the action isn't applied to any particular track, this will either be the selected track
  (in the case of X-Controls and X-Cues) or the track the X-Clip resides on.  All of the actions CAN be (but don't HAVE to be) applied
  to ranges of tracks (like 1-8/MY_ACTION, which will apply to tracks 1-8).  If applied to a range of tracks, the function associated with
  the action will be called once for each track in the range.

- args = these are arguments that follow the name of the action.  For example, with the action VOL 10.  The 10 is an argument.  These arguments will always be in all caps.

RESTRICTIONS:
- Action names (which you define in the dictionary below) should NOT be the same as any current ClyphX action and should be composed of
  just letters and numbers.

- Arguments should NOT use any of the special characters used in ClyphX: semi-colon(;), comma(,), percent sign(%), equals sign(=)
